You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Astro framework for full-stack scalable web development.
This is a monorepo project containing a FastAPI backend and an Astro frontend.

Key Principles
    - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python or Astro examples.
    - Leverage Astro's partial hydration and multi-framework support effectively.
    - Prioritize static generation and minimal JavaScript for optimal performance.
    - Use descriptive variable names and follow Astro's naming conventions.
    - Organize files using Astro's file-based routing system.

Python/FastAPI
    - Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
    - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
    - File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
    - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
    - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
    - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

Backend Dependencies
  - FastAPI
  - Pydantic v2
  - Async database libraries like asyncpg or aiomysql
  - SQLAlchemy 2.0 (if using ORM features)

Frontend Dependencies
  - Astro
  - Tailwind CSS
  - DaisyUI
  - TypeScript
  - React

Error Handling and Validation
    - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
    - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
    - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

FastAPI-Specific Guidelines
  - Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
  - Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
  - Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
  - Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
  - Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
  - Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
  - Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
  - Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
  - Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.
  
Performance Optimization
  - Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
  - Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
  - Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
  - Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.
  
Key Conventions
  1. Rely on FastAPIâ€™s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
  2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
  3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
     - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
     - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
     - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.

Astro Project Structure
  - Use the recommended Astro project structure:
    - src/
      - components/
      - layouts/
      - pages/
      - styles/
    - public/
    - astro.config.mjs

  Component Development
  - Create .astro files for Astro components.
  - Use framework-specific components (React, Vue, Svelte) when necessary.
  - Implement proper component composition and reusability.
  - Use Astro's component props for data passing.
  - Leverage Astro's built-in components like <Markdown /> when appropriate.

  Routing and Pages
  - Utilize Astro's file-based routing system in the src/pages/ directory.
  - Implement dynamic routes using [...slug].astro syntax.
  - Use getStaticPaths() for generating static pages with dynamic routes.
  - Implement proper 404 handling with a 404.astro page.

  Content Management
  - Use Markdown (.md) or MDX (.mdx) files for content-heavy pages.
  - Leverage Astro's built-in support for frontmatter in Markdown files.
  - Implement content collections for organized content management.

  Styling
  - Use DaisyUI for styling components
  - Use Astro's scoped styling with <style> tags in .astro files.
  - Leverage global styles when necessary, importing them in layouts.
  - Utilize CSS preprocessing with Sass or Less if required.
  - Implement responsive design using CSS custom properties and media queries.

  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize use of client-side JavaScript; leverage Astro's static generation.
  - Use the client:* directives judiciously for partial hydration:
    - client:load for immediately needed interactivity
    - client:idle for non-critical interactivity
    - client:visible for components that should hydrate when visible
  - Implement proper lazy loading for images and other assets.
  - Utilize Astro's built-in asset optimization features.

  Data Fetching
  - Use Astro.props for passing data to components.
  - Implement getStaticPaths() for fetching data at build time.
  - Use Astro.glob() for working with local files efficiently.
  - Implement proper error handling for data fetching operations.

  SEO and Meta Tags
  - Use Astro's <head> tag for adding meta information.
  - Implement canonical URLs for proper SEO.
  - Use the <SEO> component pattern for reusable SEO setups.

  Integrations and Plugins
  - Utilize Astro integrations for extending functionality (e.g., @astrojs/image).
  - Implement proper configuration for integrations in astro.config.mjs.
  - Use Astro's official integrations when available for better compatibility.

  Build and Deployment
  - Optimize the build process using Astro's build command.
  - Implement proper environment variable handling for different environments.
  - Use static hosting platforms compatible with Astro (Netlify, Vercel, etc.).
  - Implement proper CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.

  Styling with Tailwind CSS
  - Integrate Tailwind CSS with Astro @astrojs/tailwind

  Tailwind CSS Best Practices
  - Use Tailwind utility classes extensively in your Astro components.
  - Leverage Tailwind's responsive design utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.).
  - Utilize Tailwind's color palette and spacing scale for consistency.
  - Implement custom theme extensions in tailwind.config.cjs when necessary.
  - Never use the @apply directive

  Testing
  - Implement unit tests for utility functions and helpers.
  - Use end-to-end testing tools like Cypress for testing the built site.
  - Implement visual regression testing if applicable.

  Accessibility
  - Ensure proper semantic HTML structure in Astro components.
  - Implement ARIA attributes where necessary.
  - Ensure keyboard navigation support for interactive elements.

  Key Conventions
  1. Follow Astro's Style Guide for consistent code formatting.
  2. Use TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience.
  3. Implement proper error handling and logging.
  4. Leverage Astro's RSS feed generation for content-heavy sites.
  5. Use Astro's Image component for optimized image delivery.

  Performance Metrics
  - Prioritize Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) in development.
  - Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest for performance auditing.
  - Implement performance budgets and monitoring.

  Refer to official documentations for detailed information on components, routing, and integrations for best practices.
